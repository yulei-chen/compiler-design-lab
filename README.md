# Compiler Design Starter Code

> [!IMPORTANT]

This repository contains starter code for the Compiler Design course 2025.
The code can be found in the `java` and `haskell` branches.

There are several options how you can access the code:

## Using this Template (recommended)

This is a template repository.
That means you will find a fancy "Use this template" button on the top right.
By creating a new repository from that, you are almost ready to go.
You will receive further instructions once you got that part right and the GitHub Action
had time to run.

> [!TIP]
> This might take a few seconds. You will need to reload the page to see the changes.

## Downloading a ZIP File

You can also directly download a ZIP file containing the starter code.
As you might notice, the starter code isn't on this branch.
That means you have to select either the `java` or the `haskell` branch.
Then, you can use the integrated `Download ZIP` button.

## Cloning and Pushing

You can obviously also just clone this repository and push its content to wherever you want.
If you plan to do that, you likely know what you're doing.
